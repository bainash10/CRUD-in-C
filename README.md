# Student Records Management System

This C program demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records stored in a text file (`students.txt`). It allows users to interact with student data through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- **Create Record**: Append new student records (name and age) to `students.txt`.
- **Display Records**: Read and display all student records stored in `students.txt`.
- **Update Record**: Update a student's age based on their name.
- **Delete Record**: Remove a student record from `students.txt` by name.

## File Structure
- student_records.c: Source code file containing the main program logic.
- students.txt: Text file used to store student records.

## Note
- Ensure students.txt exists in the same directory as the compiled program.
- Modify the file paths or names as per your system configuration.
